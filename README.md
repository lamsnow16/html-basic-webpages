# Basic Web Pages Homework

After you set up your coding environment by following James' Introduction, follow along with his Basic Web Pages activity.

Yet, before you start this activity,

1. Review this [Github Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) about how to
  1. **Fork** this repository,
  2. **Clone** the Forked repo,
  3. After making changes to the code, **pushing** those changes to your Cloned code, and
  4. Submit this Clone as a **Pull Request** to the course organization's original repo.

You will follow this process, and on step 3, you will add your individual HTML file to the repo, as James instructs in the Basic Webpages chapter. **Be sure to name this new file “<code>basic-lastname.html</code>”**, where "lastname" will be your last name. For example, my homework file would be named "<code>basic-lindgren.html</code>"

    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping evertyhting</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also not how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this an ordered list</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
      <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
      <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importantce of a word or phrase.</p>
      <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

      <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
      <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
      <p>Regards,<br/>
      The Authors</p>

      <P>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS soon.</p>
